# What is a UI Designer? 

> ## Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.
> –  Paul Rand, Art Director.

### While everyone can point out examples of bad design, good design often goes unnoticed by users since it provides them a seamless experience. Good design is felt throughout the lifecycle of the product or service. 

User Interface (UI) design comes into play late in the design process, just before the product or service is handed off to developers. In UI design, all of the deliverables are exclusively **visual** and the majority of the work is the **digital** space.

UI designers are responsible for shaping the fine **look and feel** of a product, app or website while also considering its usability. They must design for a variety of functionalities, users and contexts using branding, color, photography and typography. Good user interface design facilitates the user in accomplishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself all the meanwhile being an extension of the existing brand aesthetic. UI Designers aim to create designs users will find easy to use as well as visually and emotionally pleasurable.

**Interaction Design (IxD)** could be a part of a UI Designer’s day-to-day responsibilities  -- but this is not always a requirement. This role focuses on how the visual design interacts with its users. For digital products or services, this includes motion design, such as animations and transitions. When talking about physical (non-digital) products, Interaction Design is about exploring how a user might interact physically with that particular product.

What do the terms **graphic design, branding design, web design** and **visual design** mean for UI designers? Most of them are foundational to what UI Designers do. Graphic Design is generally tied to print design, design that is seen on paper or physical spaces but having these fundamental design skills can be helpful to a UI Designer. Branding Design is focused on logo and the visual experience of a company which could be static or digital. A good UI Designer will understand how to extend a company’s brand into their design work. Web Design is probably most similar to UI Design, as it requires the consideration of users and interfaces during the creation of a comprehensive visual product. But Web Designers are limited to the web, while UI Designers traverse beyond interface designs on the internet. 

Visual Designers are often called the visual problem solvers of the design world. Not only can they bring brands to life or evolve the brand, but they can also communicate and explain design concepts and the decisions behind their work. A strong Visual Designer probably has a solid understanding of user experience, which allows them to follow the user journey of a brand. 

Web designers are a subset of Visual Designers, focused exclusively on website design work.

User Interface Designers are also a subset of Visual Designers, focusing exclusively on digital interfaces. This would include more than just websites.

## Part brand ambassador, part visual designer, part motion designer, UI Designers: 
- Have a solid understanding of typography, images, color, layout
- Understand the cultural implications of these visuals 
- Ensure the brand is expressed in the design
- Consider accessibility for all users
- Are able to provide multiple creative visual solutions 
- Leverage interaction (motion) design to solve for space considerations and to create a memorable user experience
- Work very closely with developers to ensure the interactions are implemented well
- Might have a little knowledge about development 
<br><br>

**Visual and UI Designers create designs that are:**

- Innovative
- Useful
- Aesthetic
- Understandable
- Unobtrusive
- Honest
- Long-lasting
- Detailed
- Sustainable
- Accessible

This confusion is common, even within product design circles. But conflating UI with UX, or vis versa, is problematic.
